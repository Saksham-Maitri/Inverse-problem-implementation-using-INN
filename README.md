# Inverse-problem-implementation-using-INN

These 2 files are the implementation of first 2 problems of the paper "Analyzing Inverse Problems with Invertible Neural Networks" [Link to the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.04730).

In the toy model I have used different kernel function from the one given in the book and in the robotic arm problem, i am only plotting the end points of the configurations we get by reverse pass of a position.
